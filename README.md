# Duke Robotics Club - RoboSub ROS

![Build](https://github.com/DukeRobotics/robosub-ros/workflows/build/badge.svg)
![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/dukerobotics/robosub-ros)

We are a Duke University club competing in the RoboSub Competition. Check out [our website](https://duke-robotics.com).

Our codebase is split into two repositories:

1. This repo contains all of the code required for running and testing our robots.
1. The [documentation](https://github.com/DukeRobotics/documentation) repo contains introductory projects, tutorials, and miscellaneous docs.

Our code is Dockerized, making it straightforward to set up and run. See [Running Our Docker Images](#running-our-docker-images).

Once the containers are up and running, go to [Running Our Code](#running-our-code).


## Software Stack

Our stack is split into two workspaces -- onboard and landside -- each with corresponding Docker containers of the same name. Onboard consists of the code that runs on the robot's internal computer. Landside consists of the code that should be run on your local machine. The corresponding containers are connected via a local network and are configured to share ROS messages. For an in-depth explanation of the containers, see [docker](docker).

Our codebase is powered by the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org) (ROS), and written primarily in Python.

The following components make up our software stack:

- Onboard:
    * [Controls](onboard/catkin_ws/src/controls) - Determines thruster outputs given a current and desired state.
    * [Computer Vision](onboard/catkin_ws/src/cv) - Locates objects (goals/obstacles) via camera input and machine learning.
    * [Data Pub](onboard/catkin_ws/src/data_pub) - Collects and parses data from sensors and publishes it for use by other packages.
    * [Execute](onboard/catkin_ws/src/execute) - Houses launch files that simplify starting and stopping our stack.
    * [Task Planning](onboard/catkin_ws/src/motion_planning) - Plans the tasks and motion of the robot by synthesizing inputs.
    * [Offboard Comms](onboard/catkin_ws/src/offboard_comms) - Allows communication between ROS code and the onboard Arduino.
    * [RoboSub Description](onboard/catkin_ws/src/robosub_description) - Contains files to describe and display our robot.
    * [Sensor Fusion](onboard/catkin_ws/src/sensor_fusion) - Interprets sensor data and publishes an estimation of the current robot state.
    * [Static Transforms](onboard/catkin_ws/src/static_transforms) - Makes static transforms available for other packages.
- Landside:
    * [Camera View](landside/catkin_ws/src/camera_view) - Package that allows for viewing, saving, and loading videos to simulate camera input.
    * [Joystick](landside/catkin_ws/src/joystick) - Allows manual joystick control for testing.
    * [Simulation](landside/catkin_ws/src/simulation) - Physics-enabled simulation that can be used for local testing.

## Running Our Docker Images

### Required Software
1. Download and install the appropriate Docker client.

    * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    * [Windows (Home)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/)
    * [Windows (Pro, Education, etc.)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)<br>
        :information_source: Which Windows do I have? *Settings > System > About > look at "Edition"*

1. If you want graphics forwarding over SSH:

    * [Mac: XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
    * [Windows: MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)<br>
        :warning: Open MobaXterm > click on Settings > go the X11 tab > uncheck RANDR. This allows us to use [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) over SSH.

### Pool Testing
Use these instructions when running code on the robot itself.

1. Connect your computer to the robot via Ethernet. Then SSH into the robot's onboard computer.
    ```bash
    ssh robot@192.168.1.1
    ```
1. There, make sure the latest code from this repo is pulled. Then, run the onboard container if it's not already running.
    ```bash
    docker run -td --privileged --net=host -v /home/robot/robosub-ros:/root/dev/robosub-ros dukerobotics/robosub-ros:onboard
    ```
1. Clone this repo on your local computer. In the newly-created directory (robosub-ros), run the landside container. If on Windows, use PowerShell.
    ```bash
    docker run -td -p 2201:2201 -v ${PWD}:/root/dev/robosub-ros dukerobotics/robosub-ros:landside
    ```
1. SSH into the onboard container. Password is `robotics`.
    ```bash
    ssh -p 2200 root@192.168.1.1
    ```
1. SSH into the landside container. Password is `robotics`.
    ```bash
    ssh -XY -p 2201 root@localhost
    ```
1. Inside landside, complete the connection between the two containers.
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/melodic/setup_network.bash
    ```
1. Now go to [Running Our Code](#running-our-code).

### Local Testing
Use these instructions to test code on your computer by simulating the robot's execution.

1. To run the containers, clone this repo. In the newly-created directory (`robosub-ros`), execute
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will pull the images if you don't have them, create a new network that simulates the network we use on our robot, mount the code, and start the containers.

    To update the images, or to just pull them without running them, use `docker-compose pull`.

1. SSH into the onboard container. Password is `robotics`.
    ```bash
    ssh -p 2200 root@localhost
    ```
1. SSH into the landside container. Password is `robotics`.
    ```bash
    ssh -XY -p 2201 root@localhost
    ```
1. Inside landside, complete the connection between the two containers.
    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/melodic/setup_network.bash
    ```
1. Now go to [Running Our Code](#running-our-code). Also set up our [simulation](simulation).
1. To stop and delete both containers and their network, in the `robosub-ros` directory, execute
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```


## Running Our Code

:warning: All commands should be run inside of a Docker container.

### Building and Sourcing
The following needs to be done once at the beginning, and then later only when making larger structural changes to the workspace (such as adding a package).

#### Executing Build Script
We use a custom build script that simplifies the process of building and overlaying catkin workspaces.

To build our workspaces for ROS, in the `robosub-ros` directory, execute
```bash
./build.sh <workspace>
```
where `<workspace>` is the workspace to build, either `onboard` or `landside`.

#### Sourcing Setup File
Once the build script has finished executing, source the setup file using
```bash
source <workspace>/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
where `<workspace>` is the workspace you just built. This will also be the last line that is printed from the build script, so you can also just copy and execute that.

You should now be ready to use our packages and ROS.

### Running Launch Files
Here are some common launch configurations for both pool and local testing.

* Test controls using `test_state_publisher.py`
    ```bash
    roslaunch execute motion.launch
    rosrun controls test_state_publisher.py
    rosservice call /enable_controls true
    ```

    but change the first line for local testing in the simulation
    ```bash
    roslaunch execute motion.launch sim:=true
    ```

* Pool testing with joystick (see [Joystick Documentation](landside/catkin_ws/src/joystick))
    ```bash
    ```
* Useful commands for testing
    * Stop all thrusters
        ```bash
        rosservice call /enable_controls false
        ```
    * Echo current state
        ```bash
        rostopic echo /state
        ```
    * Reset state to zero
        ```bash
        rosservice call /set_pose  # tab complete, then change w from 0.0 to 1.0
        ```

        or here's the full command for copy-pasting:
        ```bash
        rosservice call /set_pose "pose:
        header:
        seq: 0
        stamp:
        secs: 0
        nsecs: 0
        frame_id: ''
        pose:
        pose:
        position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}
        orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}
        covariance: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
        ```

### Cleaning Build
To clean the build outputs from a workspace (build, devel, and logs folders), in `robosub-ros/<workspace>/catkin_ws`, execute
```bash
catkin clean
```
