# Static Transforms

The `static_transforms.launch` file publishes the static transforms that define key parts of the robot using the ROS [static_transform_publisher](http://wiki.ros.org/static_transform_publisher). These are used to calculate the robot state based on sensor data, in addition to other uses. All measurements are in meters.

### Transform Tree

```

              |
            d |
              |
          base_link
              |
            s |
              |
         corner_link
        /     |      \
     s /    s |     s \
      /       |        \
dvl_link  cameras_link  imu_link
```

`s` = static transform (based on fixed geometry), `d` = dynamic transform (updates as the robot moves)

### Transform explanation

* `odom` - world frame
* `base_link` - robot frame, measured to center of the robot (center is the center of the four upper vectored thrusters)
* `corner_link` - a particular corner on the frame of the robot, arbitrarily chosen, but easier to point to than the elusive center of the robot. See picture. ![corner_link](corner_link.png)
* `dvl_link` - measured to bottom center point of Teledyne Workhorse Navigator 1200 DVL (might need to be a different point, look at documentation)
* `cameras_link` - measured to a location on the cameras, TBD exactly where that location is
* `imu_link` - measured to the center of the IMU
