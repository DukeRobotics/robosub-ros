## Structure

`assets`: Folder with a dummy image to test the CV package on

`launch`: Contains the various launch files for our CV package. There is a general launch file for all the cameras (`cv.launch`), and then there are specific launch files for each camera (`cv_left.launch`, `cv_right.launch`, and `cv_down.launch`). Finally, we have a launch file for our testing script `test_images.launch`.
