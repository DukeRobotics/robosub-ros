while (dist_to_gate > x | cannot see full gate)
	while (cannot see gate)
		rotate
	read vector from CV
	move along X and Y until near 0
	while (within tolerance of x and y and dist_to_gate > x)
		move to gate
		
move through gate (forward)
break		

New algo:

while (not close to gate (i.e. gate not at edge of frame) | cannot see gate (no data))
	while (cannot see gate | gate not centered (small section not centered if visible))
		rotate
	while (gate centered (within a tolerance))
		move forward

move through gate (forward)
break		

Second algo assumes that robot is never at a steep angle to the gate. This is likely a fair assumption as we start approximately in line with the gate's normal vector.
