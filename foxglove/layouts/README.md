# Duke Robotics Foxglove Layouts

This directory contains our [Foxglove layouts](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/layouts).
Some layouts require our custom extensions. See the [wiki](https://github.com/DukeRobotics/robosub-ros/wiki/Foxglove-GUI#install) for details.

## Layouts

- `controls-monitor.json`: 6 graphs for each control axis (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) plotting setpoint and control effort against time. Used to test responsiveness of robot during PID tuning.
